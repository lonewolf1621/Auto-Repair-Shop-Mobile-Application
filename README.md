This project is a comprehensive low-code mobile application developed using Alpha Transform, designed to streamline and digitalise core operational workflows within an auto repair and service environment. The primary aim of this application is to improve efficiency, enhance customer experience, and simplify day-to-day workshop management through an intuitive and well-structured interface.

The application supports several essential modules including service booking, appointment scheduling, spare-parts management, and customer workflow automation, allowing both technicians and administrative staff to manage tasks seamlessly. Through Alpha Transform’s low-code architecture, the system enables rapid form creation, multi-page navigation, conditional logic, and workflow automation without the need for extensive coding, making it ideal for dynamic workshop operations.

One of the key strengths of this project is the integration of multi-page UI logic, where users can move between service descriptions, booking forms, vehicle details, and customer records effortlessly. Each section is designed to reduce manual input, prevent repetitive data entry, and guide the user through a streamlined workflow. Spare-parts management is also built into the application, allowing staff to track inventory, update quantities, record part usage, and manage stock levels in real-time.

To demonstrate how the system could evolve into a full-stack application, the project includes a sample Flask backend that outlines potential API endpoints such as retrieving services, creating bookings, and managing spare-parts records. This backend prototype illustrates how the mobile interface could communicate with a server-side system in a production environment, enabling real-time syncing, database storage, and secure data handling.

In addition, the project repository includes project screenshots, technical diagrams, logic breakdowns, and extracted form scripts, providing a complete view of how the system operates. These documents highlight the form structures, decision-tree logic, and validation rules used throughout the app, offering insight into both the functional and design components of the application.

Overall, this Auto Repair Shop Mobile Application offers a modern, scalable, and user-friendly solution for managing automotive service operations. It showcases the potential of low-code development in building powerful workflow-driven systems and provides a strong foundation for future enhancement into a fully integrated, production-grade platform.
